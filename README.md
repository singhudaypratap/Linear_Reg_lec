# Linear Regression with scikit-learn, statsmodels and Excel

This repository contains example code for performing linear regression using two popular Python libraries: scikit-learn and statsmodels. Linear regression is a commonly used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and many other fields.

Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
<li>statsmodels</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
</ul>
Once you have installed these dependencies, you can run the example code provided in the repository.

Linear Regression with scikit-learn
The scikit-learn example code demonstrates how to perform linear regression using the LinearRegression class from the linear_model module. The code creates a simple dataset with five data points and fits a linear regression model to the data. It then plots the data points and the regression line using matplotlib.

Linear Regression with statsmodels
The statsmodels example code demonstrates how to perform linear regression using the OLS (ordinary least squares) class from the api module. The code creates the same dataset used in the scikit-learn example and fits a linear regression model to the data. It then prints a summary of the model using the summary method.

Conclusion:
Linear regression is a powerful and widely used statistical technique that can help you understand the relationship between variables in your data. The scikit-learn and statsmodels libraries provide easy-to-use tools for performing linear regression in Python. By following the examples in this repository, you can learn how to use these libraries to build and evaluate your own linear regression models.
